# 🛡️ System Security Testing Using Trojans

This project simulates a basic cybersecurity scenario demonstrating how a Trojan horse can be used to compromise a system, and more importantly, how such attacks can be detected and mitigated.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is created purely for **educational and ethical learning purposes**. Do not use any part of this code to target real systems without permission.

## 📌 Project Objective

- Understand how **Trojans** can be used in cybersecurity to test system vulnerabilities.
- Demonstrate a **client-server Trojan simulation** using Python.
- Implement **basic detection mechanisms** and log analysis.
- Educate users about **defensive security techniques**.

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts Covered

- Remote access via Trojan (Reverse Shell)
- Socket programming in Python
- Command execution via infected client
- Defensive practices:
  - System monitoring
  - Basic detection of suspicious outbound connections

---

## 📂 Project Components

### 1. `trojan_server.py` (Attacker-Side)
- Listens for incoming connections from infected clients.
- Sends commands to the victim's system.
- Receives and prints responses.

### 2. `trojan_client.py` (Victim-Side)
- Connects back to the attacker's server.
- Executes received shell commands.
- Sends back command output.

> 🔒 Optional: Include logging and alerts for system administrators to detect such connections.

---

## 🚀 How It Works (Demo Flow)

1. **Start the server** (attacker):
   ```bash
   python trojan_server.py
````

2. **Run the client** (simulated victim):

   ```bash
   python trojan_client.py
   ```

3. Server can now send shell commands, and receive output from the client.

## 🔍 Features

* 🔁 Bi-directional socket communication
* 📜 Command execution from server to client
* 🧪 Simulates system compromise
* 🚨 Extendable for defense mechanisms

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* Python 3
* Socket module
* Subprocess module
* (Optional) psutil for monitoring

---

## 🛡️ Defensive Security Practices

Include one or more of the following:

* Monitor unusual outbound traffic.
* Alert on suspicious ports or repeated remote IPs.
* Maintain system logs and audit trails.
* Use intrusion detection systems (IDS).
